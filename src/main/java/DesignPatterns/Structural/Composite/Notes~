The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that enables treating individual objects and compositions of
objects uniformly.
It allows you to build a tree structure of objects where each object in the tree can be either a composite
(containing other objects) or a leaf (a single object).

Problem It Aims to Solve
    1) Complex Hierarchies:
            Managing a tree-like structure where objects may contain other objects.
    2) Uniform Treatment of Objects:
            Need to perform operations on both individual objects (leaves) and compositions (nodes) without checking their types.
    3) Code Duplication:
            Avoid duplicating logic for handling single objects and collections of objects.
The Composite Pattern solves these issues by allowing clients to treat individual objects and composites uniformly through a common interface.


Key Concepts
    Component Interface:
         Declares common operations that can be performed on both leaf and composite objects.
    Leaf:
        Represents individual objects in the hierarchy. Implements the component interface but does not contain child components.
    Composite:
        Represents a group of objects. Implements the component interface and stores child components.
    Client:
        Interacts with objects in the hierarchy through the component interface.
