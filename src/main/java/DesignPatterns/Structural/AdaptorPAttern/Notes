The adaptor pattern lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatibe Interfaces

Lets say we have ClientClass which wants to call specificRequest Method of Adaptee class

Client{

 }


 TargetInterface{
        Request()
        }

 Adaptor implements TargetInterface{


 request(){
    this.adaptee.specificRequest();
 }

 }


 Adaptee{

    specificRequest()

}


TargetInterface target = new Adaptor(new Adaptee())
