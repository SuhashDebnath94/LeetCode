The Prototype Design Pattern is used to create new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype).
 It avoids the need for expensive or repetitive initialization of new objects, allowing object creation through cloning.

 The Prototype Pattern is beneficial when creating objects is resource-intensive or when you need to create multiple instances with similar configurations.

 Database Object Replication:
    Cloning objects like database records with minimal modification.

 Game Development:
    Cloning enemies or items with pre-defined properties.

 Java Frameworks:
    Java's Object.clone() method is an implementation of the Prototype Pattern.

 Spring Framework:
    Spring Beans with prototype scope use the Prototype Pattern.
    When a bean is configured as a prototype, a new instance is created each time the bean is requested.

 Java Util Classes:
    The java.lang.Object class provides the clone() method to create shallow copies of objects.
