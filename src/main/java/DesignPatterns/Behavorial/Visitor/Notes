The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new operations to a class hierarchy without modifying the existing classes.
It achieves this by letting you place the new behavior in a separate class (the "visitor") that "visits" the elements of the hierarchy.


Problem It Aims to Solve
        Open-Closed Principle Violation:
            Adding new operations to a class hierarchy often requires modifying existing classes, which violates the Open-Closed Principle.
        Tight Coupling Between Data Structures and Operations:
            When operations are tightly coupled with the data structure, adding new operations requires changes across multiple classes.
        Difficulty in Extending Operations:
            Adding operations to unrelated classes in a consistent way is challenging without a centralized mechanism.
    The Visitor Pattern solves these problems by decoupling operations from the objects they operate on.

Key Concepts
    Visitor Interface:
        Declares a visit method for each type of element in the object structure.
    Concrete Visitor:
        Implements the operations defined in the visitor interface.
    Element Interface:
        Defines an accept method that takes a visitor.
    Concrete Element:
        Implements the element interface and allows the visitor to access its data.
    Object Structure:
        A collection of elements that can be visited.

Real-World Use Cases
    Compilers:
        Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) where operations like optimization, type checking, and code generation are applied.
    UI Frameworks:
        Rendering different UI components with consistent operations like drawing, resizing, or styling.
    Serialization:
        Visiting objects in a graph to convert them into a different format like JSON, XML, or binary.
    Workflow Engines:
        Applying operations to workflow nodes based on their types.

When to Use:
    Unchanging Element Structure:
        When the object structure is stable, but new operations need to be added frequently.
    Centralized Operations:
        When operations need to be grouped and applied consistently across different types.
    Complex Object Structures:
        When working with a tree or composite structure of objects.
When Not to Use:
    Frequent Changes in Element Structure:
        Adding or modifying elements requires updating all visitors, leading to high maintenance costs.
    Simple Hierarchies:
        When there are few classes and operations, the overhead of implementing the Visitor pattern might outweigh its benefits.
    Violation of Encapsulation:
        Visitors might access and manipulate an element's internal state, potentially breaking encapsulation.
