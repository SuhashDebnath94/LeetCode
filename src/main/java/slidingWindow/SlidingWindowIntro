Suppose you have an array
    27, 45, 64, 2, 14, 3, 5, 8

    And youre given a range

    suppose 3

    Now youre given to find the maximum sub array sum of given range ie

    27, 45, 64 is a sub array
    45, 64, 2 is a sub array
    64, 2, 14 is a sub array
    and so on

    find all the sum and max.

    So Brute force approach

        for(i= 0-> n)
        {
            for(j=i;j<i+3;j++)
            {
                add all j values
                store

             }
         }

         From the stored values find max

    Now are you doing any repitetive work?

    Yes.
    you are adding index 1, 2, 3
    then addin 2, 3, 4
    then 3, 4,5

    so when adding 1,2, 3 youre already have the addition of 2,3
    so why do it again in step 2?

    In step 2:
        Remove 1
        add 4

        Keep doing this.

    So now we notice we are sliding the window, 1 index at a time.

    So we know:
        1) We have a window
        2) The window is continuous
        3) we slide the window.

        So:
            When question has array or string
            and it is related to sub array/substring
            we will need to find the largest/maximum/minimum
            We will be given the window size

        There are 2 types of sliding window problems,
            1) fixed size window
            2) variable size window

            variable size:
                Suppose youre given to find the largest subarray whose sum is 5


   Problems:
    1) Fixed size:
        -> Maximum/minimum subarray of size k
        -> 1st -ve in everyWindow sie of k
        -> count occurence of anagrams
        -> max of all sub arrays of size k


    2) Variable size:
        -> largest subarray of sum k
        -> largest substring of k distinct character
        -> length of largest substring no repeating characters
        -> pick toy
        -> minimum window substring
